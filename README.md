I made this quick text file parser because I wanted to backup the notes from the notes app on my phone (Samsung) to my PC as one big text file. In doing this, I wanted to maintain the formatting of the notes as they existed in the
 notes app in addition to making sure I know which note I am reading by recording the note's title followed by its contents.
